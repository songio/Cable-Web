         <p>Hello, and welcome to our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy helps you to make informed decisions about your relationship with us, so please read it carefully.</p>

         <h5>1. Introduction</h5>
         <p>Thanks for choosing Cable. To provide you with the Cable Service (or “Service”, both as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use), Cable USA Inc. (“Cable”, “we”, “us”, “our”) needs to collect some information about you, and this Privacy Policy is where we describe the information we collect, what we do with it, and how you can manage and control the use of your information. By using or interacting with the Service, you are entering into a binding contract with us and consenting to the use of your information as explained in this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree with these terms, then please don’t use the Service.</p>

         <h5>2. The information we collect</h5>
         <dl>
           <dt>2.1 Registration data</dt>
           <dd>When you sign up for the Service, we may collect information we ask you for, like your username, password, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, postal code, and country. We may also collect information you voluntarily add to your profile, such as your mobile phone number and mobile service provider. If you connect to the Service using your Facebook credentials, you authorise us to collect your authentication information, such as your username, encrypted access credentials, and other information that may be available on or through your Facebook account, including your name, profile picture, country, hometown, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, friends’ names and profile pictures and networks. We may store this information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in Section 3.</dd>

           <dt>2.2 Usage & log data</dt>
           <dd>When you use the Service, we automatically collect certain information, including: (i) information about your interactions with the Service, including with songs, playlists, other Cable users, advertising (if any), products and services which are offered, linked to or made available on the Service; (ii) the details of the queries you make; (iii) User Content (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use); (iv) technical data, which may include the URL you are coming from, your IP address, unique device ID, network and computer performance, browser type, language and identifying information, transactional information enabling digital rights management, operating system, and Spotify application version; and (v) location information. If you have connected your account to Facebook, we may receive similar information related to your interactions with the Service on Facebook. We may store this information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in Section 3.</dd>

           <dt>2.3 Other Services</dt>
           <dd>You may integrate your Spotify account with third party services besides Facebook (“Other Integrated Services”). If you do, we may receive, use and share the categories of information described above, including information made publically available on or through your account of such Other Integrated Service, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</dd>

           <dt>2.4 Cookies & similar technologies</dt>
           <dd>A cookie is a small text file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us or our business partners to recognise your device when you return to the Service. We may use cookies to perform functions essential to the operation of the Service, track site usage and trends, provide advertising on the Service, and improve and customise your Cable experience. We may also allow certain business partners to place or recognise cookies for those purposes.</dd>

           <dt>2.5 Sweepstakes, contests, & surveys</dt>
           <dd>From time to time, we may offer you the chance to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys (“Special Promotions”) through the Service. Participation in a Special Promotion is entirely voluntary. A Special Promotion may be governed by a privacy policy and/or terms and conditions that are separate from this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use). If the provisions of the Special Promotion’s privacy policy or terms and conditions conflict with this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions of Use, those separate terms and conditions or privacy policy shall prevail. If you choose to participate in a Special Promotion, we may ask you for certain personal information in addition to what is stated in this Privacy Policy. That additional information may be combined with other account information and may be used and shared as described in this Privacy Policy.</dd>
         </dl>

         <h5>3. How we use the information we collect</h5>
         <p>We may use the information we collect, including your personal information, to: (i) provide, personalise, and improve your experience with the Service and products and services made available through the Service, for example by providing customised or localised content and advertising; (ii) ensure technical functioning of the Service and products and services made available through the Service, develop new products and services, and analyse your use of the Service, including your interaction with applications, advertising, products and services that are made available, linked to or offered in the Service; (iii) communicate with you for Service-related purposes, including promotional e-mails or messages; (iv) enable and promote the Service, including features and content of the Service and products and services made available through the Service, such as sharing, user interactions, notifications and suggestions, and integration with third party services; (v) enforce this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions of Use, including to protect the rights, property or safety of Cable, users or any other person and the copyright-protected content of the Service; and (vi) as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>

         <h5>4. How we share the information we collect</h5>
         <p>We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, as follows:</p>
         <dl>
           <dt>4.1 Finding you and sharing within the Cable Service</dt>
           <dd>The Cable Service is a social service which offers many ways to find, enjoy, and share content, and we enable and encourage users to explore who else is using the Service and their public profiles. Much of your Cable profile information is publicly available to others by default, such as name and/or username, profile picture, and playlists you create or subscribe to. We may use your public information to promote the Service and to help others find you and/or your Cable profile content, including through Facebook and Other Integrated Services. Your activity on the Service, including but not limited to music you listen to or add to your profile and Third Party Applications that you add or use will automatically appear in the activity feed of friends. We may use your information to notify others, including on the Service, via e-mail, and through Facebook and Other Integrated Services, about news related to your profile and activity, such as that you have joined Cable, take actions related to their Cable profiles or content which they subscribe to, or other actions which we think may be of interest to them. Likewise, we may notify you about such activity of other users. Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available profile information, and what you share with others in section 5 below.</dd>

           <dt>4.2 Sharing with Facebook and other services</dt>
           <dd>If you connect to Cable using Facebook or otherwise connect your Cable account to an Other Integrated Service, the default setting is generally that Cable automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on Facebook or the Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service. See section 5 below to learn how you can disable sharing of information on Facebook and Other Integrated Services.
         Cable also enables you to share a particular item of content, on an individual basis, to third party services or other Cable users by using the share functionality in the Service. Please note that sharing of such content on a third party service may be posted as activity on the Service, regardless of your account settings. To share an individual item of content to a third party service, you’ll be prompted to enter your access credentials for that third party service. Cable may store your username and an access token or similar credentials obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.
         You understand and agree that Facebook’s or other third parties’ use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and Cable’s use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy. </dd>

           <dt>4.3 Other sharing</dt>
           <dd>In addition to the above, we may also share your information to third parties for these limited purposes:
         1.to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;
         2.to respond to legal process (e.g. a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the rights and property of Cable, including to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use and Mobile Terms; and to address fraud, security or technical issues;
         3.to inform business partners about use of the Service and products and services made available through the Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not reveal your identity;
         4.if you expressly opt in to such sharing.</dd>

           <dd>You agree and understand that the privacy policies of the third parties will govern all use of information that we provide to it or that it collects from you.</dd>
         </dl>

         <h5>5. Your preferences</h5>
         <p>Through your settings, you can choose which communications you receive from us, manage your public profile information, and set your sharing preferences. However, please note that it may not be possible to make certain information private on the Service, including your name and/or username and profile picture. Such information and other information which are set to “public” in your settings, such as playlists, may be used, re-shared or linked to by others on the Service or others across the web, so please use Cable carefully and manage your account settings regularly. Remember that if you make profile content private, others who already subscribe to or otherwise have the details of such content will still have access to it. Also keep in mind that playlists and other content added to your profile may include personal information, such as username, which could enable other persons to find you in the Cable Service or other services.</p>
         <p>To change, customise, or limit access to or sharing of information collected from Facebook or Other Integrated Service, please visit your account settings on that service.</p>

         <h5>6. Links</h5>
         <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content which links to third party websites. We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal information.</p>

         <h5>7. Security</h5>
         <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ information. Your password protects your user account, so you should use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and sign off after having used the Cable Service. While we take reasonable data protection precautions, no security measures are completely secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information at any time.</p>

         <h5>8. Children</h5>
         <p>For users in the United States, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, do not use the Service and do not provide any personal information to us. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it.</p>

         <h5>9. Contact us</h5>
         <p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@cabl.in">privacy@cabl.in.</a></p>

         <h5>10. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h5>
         <p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please visit this Privacy Policy regularly. If we make changes which we believe are material, we will inform you through the Service. Your continued use of the Service thereafter constitutes acceptance of the changes.</p>
